                    Cameras will be installed on every traffic light which would monitor the traffic
                    density at each junction and using machine learning would detect different objects such as 
                    cars, people, animals and also count the number of each object, then depending upon the 
                    density of cars on each juntion, the traffic light would stay green for the lane with 
                    higher number of cars, which would help in clearing the traffic more efficiently.

                    This feature would be useful in office hours. with help of this system we can reduce the 
                    travel time of of office workers by a significant amount. this system would also help 
                    people going through busy traffic through different narrow streets, and would also help in 
                    festival season.
                    <br><br>

                    A live feed from these cameras will directly get relayed to police headquarters so that 
                    they can monitor the traffic themselves and have a better control over traffic violations.

                    These cameras will help us detect accidents and also notify the required authorities at 
                    the time of emergency. An alert will be sent to the nearest police station and hospital 
                    at the time of emergency so that the situation is cleared as fast as possible and also 
                    save lives.
                    <br><br>

                    These cameras will also help in catching people who dont follow traffic rules such as 
                    overspeeding, jumping a red light, taking a wrong side fot travel.

                    The data regarding the density of traffic at different places at different point of time 
                    will be saved and using the machine learning agorithm we will be able to predict the

                    An application will be build based on this data which will help us guide people through 
                    the city by choosing the best possible path for them.
                    <br><br>

                    This system has a potential to be even more accurate that google maps as google maps is 
                    made for the people all around the globe using satellites, but our app will be based on 
                    India specific data collected using ground cameras over time.

                    Using the data collected we can guide people on what routes to take at what time of the 
                    day. This will take the user from point A to point B more quickly that other methods.
                    <br><br>

                    Users can also opt for shortest route. This would taka a user from point A to B through 
                    the shortest path possible. This feature will help people save on fuel. So, this feature 
                    can be used by people running low on petrol or diesal or people who care for the 
                    environment.
                    <br><br>

                    Another option would be to choose for the most convenient route which would take the 
                    people through areas with least traffic density and wide roads. This feature would be for 
                    those people who like to drive and are unable to enjoy it because of high traffic.

                    the people safer. This feature can used by cab drivers, which would instill a sense of

                    The cameras will also fix a huge drawback of self driving cars which is to identify
